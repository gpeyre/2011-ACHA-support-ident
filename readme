Code to reproduce the three figures of the paper:

Sharp Support Recovery from Noisy Random Measurements by L1 minimization
C. Dossal, M.L. Chabanol, G. Peyre, J. Fadili
Preprint Hal-00553670, 2011
http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00553670/

Each figure is generated by a cript genfigX.m where X=1,2,3.

Beware that the data is collected in an infinite loop ("while true") 
so you have to manually stop it when enough samples have been collected 
and run the end of the script to plot and save the figure.
